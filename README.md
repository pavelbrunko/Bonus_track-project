## Bonus_track project

In the bonus_track project, students of non-IT areas of ITMO are given the opportunity to undergo professional retraining and receive a diploma of an IT specialist. Within the framework of this course there is a direction "Data Analysis Technologies", in which students are taught statistics, working with SQL queries, introduced to NoSQL databases and also immersed in the world of machine learning methods. 

As a final project, students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their skills in working with data. 

My final project is a Jupiter notebook, in which work has been done on a small set of fastfood data from well-known American chains. The project implements data processing (removal of duplicates, exclusion of features unnecessary for research, identification and elimination of outliers and data normalization), plotting of a rocky scree and the use of the k-Means unsupervised learning method to divide data into several clusters. At the end, a conclusion is given on the work done
